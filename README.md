# Task 4 – Global Traffic Accident Analysis with Data Visualization
---
This project is part of my Data Science internship at SkillCraft Technology.The main objective is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & extract meaningful insights from a global traffic accident dataset using data visualization techniques.
---
Objective
To explore and visualize traffic accident data to identify critical patterns related to:

Time of occurrence (day/night, hours)

Weather and road conditions

Causes of accidents

Casualty rates

Geographical distribution (by country)

Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – Data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Key Visualizations Created
Countplot – Distribution of accident causes

Pie Chart – Proportion of accidents by weather condition

Boxplot – Road condition vs casualties

Histogram – Accidents by hour of day

Bar Plot – Top 10 countries with highest accident counts

Heatmap – Accident hotspots by time & day

Line Plot – Monthly trend of accident counts

Grouped Bar Plot – Casualties by road & weather condition

Countplot – Distribution of accidents by day type (weekdays vs weekends)

Pie Chart – Fatality proportion in different visibility conditions

Insights Derived
Most accidents occur during clear weather, suggesting human-related causes are dominant.

Afternoons and rush hours are peak times for accident occurrences.

Poor road conditions significantly increase the average number of casualties.

Speeding, distractions, and drunk driving are leading causes.

Weekend accidents tend to result in higher fatality rates.

Files Included
accident_analysis.ipynb – Main Python script with EDA and visualizations

Conclusion
This task strengthened my ability to:

Perform insightful EDA with Python

Build strong visual storytelling with Seaborn & Matplotlib

Communicate real-world data problems through impactful graphs
